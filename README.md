# pngparltmps
This application aims to visually present the type of parliamentarians we have in the Papua New Guinea National Parliament

# How it Works
I have scanned and extracted the information from the Papua New Guinea National Parliament website and stored it in a JSON file named >data.json

The data stored here is then loaded into the index.html javascript file which is then displayed using visual charts designed with the help of d3js

#how to make it work
> clone this repo

> cd into the pngparltmps folder

> run npm install

> then finally run node app.js

> go to your browser and load localhost:3000
